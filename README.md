The best way to master a foreign language is to read, listen or watch content in this languange. And the key ingridient is to have real interest in the theme of the content, be it travel, science, news, lifestyle, DIY, etc (not watered down textbooks).

In this list I'll gather links to such materials organized by category. You'll need at least A2 level to be able to understand it. The goal is to choose simplier text and slower speech.
